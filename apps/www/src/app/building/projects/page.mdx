# Projects — Built & In Progress

Over time, I’ve worked on various projects, both for clients and for myself. Here are a few of my favorites — a mix of things I’ve already built and what I’m currently working on. Each project has taught me something valuable.

<br />

## Internal Web Analytics tool with AI 

<VideoPlayer src="/portfolio.mp4" />

<br />

This internal tool was built at [confident](https://confident.ch) to automate the process of reviewing client websites and providing feedback. I helped develop an AI-powered workflow that uses the Google API to check customer reviews, Lighthouse for performance audits, and OpenAI’s API to assist with content evaluation and reporting.

*Note: This tool was created at [confident](https://confident.ch). The code is proprietary, but I’m happy to share more about my contributions.*

## Ennio Grossi – Portfolio Website

[enniogrossi.com](https://www.enniogrossi.com)
<br />
This is the portfolio of a talented graphic designer. I really like this project because of its minimal design and simplicity. Ennio can easily add new projects, and they’re automatically displayed — no extra effort needed.

We designed it together, and I built the site using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend and [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as the CMS. It’s clean, fast, and fully editable.

<br />

## Real Estate Platform – Dubai

[helvetiasands.ch](https://www.helvetiasands.ch/)
<br />
This project was for a real estate business in Dubai. They needed a site that could display listings from an external API and also allow them to manage their own content. The goal was to build something flexible, with a CMS that gave them full control.

To reduce costs, I went with a self-hosted CMS. I handled both the design and development of the platform, which includes a front-facing site and admin interface.

<br />

## Other Professional Projects (Not Publicly Available)

In addition to the projects above, I’ve worked on several impactful platforms as part of my professional roles. These include:

- **Multi-tenant CMS & Marketplace**  
  Developed features and maintained a platform used by 180+ opticians, including a custom CMS for site deployment and a multi-tenant marketplace. Tech: React, Next.js, Supabase, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions.

- **Urban Golf MVP**  
  Sole developer for a real-time scoring web app, leveraging Supabase’s real-time features and websockets.

<br />

*Note:Due to client privacy and company policies, these projects are not available to view online, but I’m happy to discuss the challenges and solutions I contributed to in more detail.*

## Personal Content Dashboard (In Progress)

Building a personal brand today requires consistency — across projects, social platforms, and job materials. I noticed that most tools only solve a small part of that, so I started building my own dashboard.

It’s a central place where I can manage everything: schedule posts for X, update my CV, track projects, and distribute content, all from one spot.

I'm building it using modern tools to keep the setup fast, clean, and developer-friendly:
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the frontend
- [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for working with the database
- [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as the backend and storage layer
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) for type-safe APIs without the boilerplate
- [Mux](https://www.mux.com/) for video uploads and playback

The goal is to create a reliable and modern stack that’s easy to extend, with a great dev experience and a fast user experience.
I've open-sourced the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/alessiotortora), so others can learn from it, build on it, or use it as a starting point.

## Self-Hosting & DevOps Experiments

I’ve been diving into self-hosting as a way to better understand how modern infrastructure works, from Docker and reverse proxies to monitoring and analytics.

For example, the analytics running on this site are entirely self-hosted. I'm currently using a mix of [Umami](https://umami.is/) and [OpenPanel](https://openpanel.dev/), both lightweight, privacy-friendly analytics tools, deployed via Docker on my own server. Managing these setups has taught me a lot about containerization, networking, and maintaining services in production-like environments.

This hands-on approach helps me build a deeper understanding of hosting, performance, and system reliability. All of which directly influence how I design and deploy projects.

I’ll continue updating this page as new projects go live or evolve. Each one is a step forward in refining how I design, build, and solve real-world problems on the web.
