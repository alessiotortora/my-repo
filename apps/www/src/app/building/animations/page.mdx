# Animations & Microinteractions

Animations on the web can be tricky, browser inconsistencies, performance considerations, and implementation complexity often make it feel like more work than it’s worth. Because of that, they’re not used as much as they could be. Good animation takes time to get right, to make it feel smooth, intentional, and not just flashy.

But when done well, even subtle motion can make a big difference.

I’ve been diving deeper into animation lately, especially inspired by [Emil Kowalski](https://emilkowal.ski/), whose work opened my eyes to how much personality and polish animations can bring to the user experience. His explorations showed me how animations aren’t just aesthetic, they’re functional, meaningful, and delightful.


## Why Microinteractions Matter

Microinteractions — small, purposeful animations. Help users understand feedback, system status, or flow through an interface. They guide attention, make transitions feel smoother, and often make a product feel more “alive.”

In a world where web apps are expected to feel as fluid as native ones, microinteractions are becoming a baseline expectation. Good motion can elevate even the most minimal UI.


## Animations I'm Exploring

Below are some of the animation experiments and components I’ve been building as I explore what motion can add to UX on the web.

### Cursor Animation

<Cursor/>
<br />
Here’s a simple cursor animation, nothing complex, but when used right, it adds that extra touch of personality and smoothness to the experience. It’s a small detail, but it can subtly signal that the product is crafted with care.

### Folder Opening Animation

<Folder />
<br />
The folder-opening animation adds a playful yet practical moment of motion. It reinforces the idea that something is being revealed or accessed, making the interaction feel more intuitive. It's a small detail, but it helps create a smoother, more engaging user experience that goes beyond static clicks.
